# Machine-Learning
In this repository, there are projects developed in the jupyter notebook environment using machine learning algorithms in the field of health.
## Predict Diabetes
In this project, data on diabetes patients were collected.

There are 8 features and 1 target variable in this data.

6 feature selection methods were applied on these data, and as a result, the number of features was reduced from 8 to 4.

First, 8 features and 9 machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset.

As a result of this application, the model was evaluated according to 6 performance metrics.

Then, the number of features was reduced to 4 by applying feature extraction and 9 machine learning algorithms were applied to the data set.

Evaluation of the model was made again according to 6 performance metrics and the performance metrics of the model before feature extraction were compared.

As a result of this comparison, the success of the model has increased significantly after feature extraction.

The feature selection methods used :
1. Chi Square Test
2. Mutual Information
3. MRMR
4. ReliefF
5. Step Forward Selection
6. Step Backward Selection

The machine learning algorithms used :
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. K Nearest Neighborhood
4. Decision Tree
5. Random Forest
6. Multi-Layer Perceptron
7. Gradient Boosting Machines
8. XGBoost
9. CatBoost

The performance metrics used :
1. Confusion Matrix
2. Accuracy
3. Recall
4. Specificity
5. Precision
